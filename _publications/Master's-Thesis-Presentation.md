Thesis on "Crisis and Recovery in a start-up. The case of the Slovak company Synculario". During a 4-month internship at the Slovak start-up Synculario and at its parent company 26HOUSE, the causes of Synculario's financial decline were investigated through financial analysis, facts recollection, and staff surveys, and categorized based on available literature. The same methodology was used to analyze the restructuring process aimed at recovery.
