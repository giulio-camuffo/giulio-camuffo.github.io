Thesis on "Crisis and Recovery in a start-up. The case of the Slovak company Synculario". Following a 4-months internship in the Slovak start-up Synculario and its parent company 26HOUSE, I investigated the causes of the financial decline of the start-up, analyzing them according to financial analysis, facts recollection, and staff surveys, and categorizing them according to the available literature on the topic. Then, the same process has been applied to the following restructuring process implemented in order to recover from the crisis.
