Hi there! I am Giulio, a masterâ€™s degree student enrolled in the Business and Administration course at 
                          University of Bologna (Italy), who is only missing the writing of his thesis before graduating (I expect to 
                          graduate by March 2023 at the latest). 
                          My level of English is advanced (C1 certified) and my master's degree was taught completely in English, the course being international, as well as my Erasmus+ international experience.
                          I have recently been an Erasmus+ Exchange Student at SGH, Warsaw School of Economics for the Winter Semester 2021/2022 (GPA 4.0/4.0). 

The main areas I deal with are Business Analysis, Business Strategy, Project Management, Economic Development, Entrepreneurship and Data Analysis/Business Intelligence.
In addition to these main ones, other areas of interest that I would like to possibly deal with in the future are Corporate Governance, Performance Management, M&A and Behavioural Economics.
                          
I decided to write my master's thesis in the field of Corporate Governance/ Network Analysis/ Entrepreneurship with a 3-months internship (September-November 2022) in Bratislava, where I will be CEO Assistant of 26HOUSE, one of the top Slovak/Czech ERP providers (Odoo) of complex IT and consulting services. This experience will allow me to analyse the relationship between the company and its daughter company, Synculario, an outsourcing IT support startup, both based in Bratislava (Slovakia) and,specifically, to analyse the correlation between performance drivers in 2022.

As for my professional experience, I recently completed a two-month remote intensive internship (March-May 2022) as a Business Analyst for OESON, in which I applied what I learned in the Business Intelligence course, in terms of producing 
                          complex measures with DAX language, creating interactive dashboards, cleaning and preprocessing of data, using R for hypothesis testing and correlation analysis, and ultimately received a Letter of 
                          Recommendation from the CEO of the company for commitment and merit in all tasks performed in my domain.I have achieved such result studying throughout my master's degree (two years in September 2022) Power BI in the 
                          Business Intelligence course (completed with honors) related to the use of DAX language (creation of complex measures, calculated columns, time intelligence) and interactive dashboards. However, my passion for the world of Data Analysis does not end in the software learned so far; in fact, 
                          I am very eager to constantly continue to learn new tools to expand my analytical and technical knowledge, such as Tableau, SQL, and any other software that is necessary to learn for my professional career.
                          
   In addition, in parallel with my studies and the Business Analyst job, I am also having another part-time internship (March-September 2022) as Business Development Lead for The THRIVE Project. This is an Australian Non-profit and this role has let me developed strategies and growth plans by analysing market dynamics and characteristics of very different sectors, to indicate the best moves to spread the company's vision and mission.
I have been a Project manager involved so far in three crucial sustainability projects to promote the corporate framework and develop new partnerships and collaborations with organisations, institutions and NGOs working in the areas related to the 14 SDGs.
But not only that. Working for an organization with such a focus on environmental sustainability has also allowed me to getting closer to researchers from all over the world who are experts in every possible field, of all ages, with the opportunity to collaborate with them on various projects and consequently learning the type of approach used in research.

Among my passions and hobbies, I love travelling, hiking (and generally any kind of outdoor tourism), playing chess, watching TV series (especially anime), and meet new people from different cultures. Among all these, however, my greatest passion is music, of which I am a great devotee (especially the vast world of electronic music, but not only) of which you can find out all about in my Spotify profile (https://open.spotify.com/user/2147ostd2xil2uieljbmk6fri?si=9645c77e8082468e) .Indeed, apart from the genre I am in the mood for at a specific moment, I listen to more or less at an average of five to six hours a day, and which I am always hungry to discover new.
