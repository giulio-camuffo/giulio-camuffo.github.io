Hi there! I am Giulio, and I am from Italy. The main areas I deal with are Controlling, Business and Financial Analysis, Project and Performance Management, and Business Intelligence. In addition to these main ones, other areas that I am interested in are Corporate Governance, Data processing, and Behavioural Economics.
                        
I have been working for the European Central Bank in Frankfurt am Main (Germany) since the 15th of April 2023, first as Finance Trainee and then as an Analyst in the Budgeting and Controlling division (Directorate of Finance), specifically in the Projects & Analytics team. My primary responsibilities included managing budget allocations and adjustments, based on Business Areas' needs and Budget Partners' input. As controller, I periodically run different types of reconciliations to ensure financial data alignment in SAP and in our dashboards, or to identifying any system issues for IT investigation. In addition, I drafted the ECB key budget dossiers, such as Budget Planning, Year-End Report, and Mid-Year Forecasts, by budget/actuals data extraction and elaboration. In the team, I oversaw the creation and maintenance of masterdata in the main financial modules and environments of SAP, ensuring that any type of financial or headcount allocation per cost object is accurately recorded and monitored. I have also contributed to enhancing this masterdata cycle within the team by implementing various VBA automations. Then, as the knowledge management responsible in the team, I was regularly updating and reviewing our technical procedures while reorganizing the Darwin space, to improve knowledge sharing and task handover.

Also, I was hired on a short-term direct contract as an internal Business Consultant full-time to support strategic and financial analysis for 26HOUSE, an ERP consulting company based in Bratislava (Slovakia), and its subsidiary, a start-up named Synculario. My work focused on conducting financial reconciliations, preparing performance dashboards (Excel or Power BI), performing industry analysis on the Czech/Slovak ERP market, and producing executive presentations for 26HOUSE board meetings. Alongside, through financial statement analysis, surveys, and interviews, I investigated the root causes of the financial crisis that impacted Synculario in 2022. I analyzed the crisis triggers, examined the solutions that had been adopted by the new administration to recover, together with the restructuring strategies implemented, and reflected on broader implications for internal governance and network resilience in tech-oriented start-ups. The results of this investigation later formed the basis of my Masterâ€™s thesis, "Crisis and Recovery in a Start-Up: The Case of the Slovak Company Synculario".

My academic background in Economics and Management, with a focus on Business and Administration, has provided me with a solid foundation in cost accounting, performance analysis, and business analytics. This includes studying key profitability ratios, such as Return on Assets, Return on Equity, and Net Profit Margin. Additionally, I gained proficiency in utilizing tools to create customized and interactive data visualization dashboards based on large amounts of data, like Power BI, or using some programming languages (R, Python) for further elaboration. I have also been an Erasmus+ exchange student at SGH, Warsaw School of Economics (Warsaw, Poland) for the winter semester 2021/2022 (GPA 4.0/4.0).

As for my other professional experience, I completed a three-month remote intensive internship (March-May 2022) as a Business Analyst for OESON (remotely, the company is based in Indore, India), in which I applied what I learned in the Business Intelligence course taken during my master's degree, in terms of producing complex measures with DAX language, creating interactive dashboards, cleaning and preprocessing of data, using R for hypothesis testing and correlation analysis. However, my passion for the world of Data Analysis does not end in the software learned so far; in fact, 
I am very eager to constantly continue to learn new tools to expand my analytical and technical knowledge, such as Tableau, SQL, and any other software that is necessary to learn for my professional career.
                          
   In addition, in parallel with my studies and the Business Analyst internship, I have completed a part-time six-month internship (March-September 2022) as Business Development Intern for The THRIVE Project, an Australian Non-profit. 
I have been a Project manager involved so far in three crucial sustainability projects to promote the corporate framework and develop new partnerships and collaborations with organizations, institutions, and NGOs working in the areas related to the 14 SDGs.
But not only that. Working for an organization with such a focus on environmental sustainability has also allowed me to get closer to researchers from all over the world who are experts in every possible field, of all ages, with the opportunity to collaborate with them on various projects and consequently learn the type of approach used in research.

Among my passions and hobbies, I love traveling, hiking (and generally any kind of outdoor tourism), playing chess, watching TV series, and meet new people from different cultures. Among all these, however, my greatest passion is music, of which I am a great devotee (especially the vast world of electronic music). If you are passionate too, you can find out all about my music tastes in my Spotify profile (https://open.spotify.com/user/2147ostd2xil2uieljbmk6fri?si=9645c77e8082468e). I love to discover new sounds and interesting songs, as well as keeping on classify them into different playlists, to have something suitable to play in different situations and moods.
