Hi there! I am Giulio, and I come from Italy. On 30 March 2023, I graduated from the Master's degree in Economics and Management, International curriculum in Business and Administration, at the University of Bologna (Italy), with a final grade of 110/110 cum laude. My level of English is advanced (C1 certificate) and my Master's degree was taught entirely in English, the course being international, as were my international Erasmus+ experiences in Warsaw and Bratislava. I was recently an Erasmus+ exchange student at SGH, Warsaw School of Economics for the winter semester 2021/2022 (GPA 4.0/4.0).

The main areas I deal with are Business Analysis, Business Strategy, Project Management, Business Development, Entrepreneurship and Data Analysis/Business Intelligence.
In addition to these main ones, other areas of interest that I would like to possibly deal with in the future are Corporate Governance, Performance Management, M&A and Behavioural Economics.
                          
For the final dissertation, I decided to combine the process of writing my Master's thesis, in the field of Administration and Network and Crisis Management, with a 4-month internship (September-December 2022) under the Erasmus+ program for one of the leading Slovak/Czech providers of complex ERP (mainly Odoo) and consulting services, called 26HOUSE, based in Bratislava (Slovakia). During the period, I covered various roles, starting as CEO Assistant, then as ERP Specialist Intern, and finally (and mainly) as Business Consultant Intern. With my thesis project, titled "Crisis and recovery in a start-up. The case of the Slovak company Synculario", I conducted an empirical analysis to identify and structure the key factors and root causes of Synculario's crisis in 2022, which is 26HOUSE's subsidiary. In addition, I researched the solutions that have been adopted by the new administration to recover, together with the restructuring strategies implemented.

As for my other professional experience, I completed a two-month remote intensive internship (March-May 2022) as a Business Analyst for OESON, in which I applied what I learned in the Business Intelligence course taken during my master's degree, in terms of producing 
                          complex measures with DAX language, creating interactive dashboards, cleaning and preprocessing of data, using R for hypothesis testing and correlation analysis. Finally, I have even received a Letter of 
                          Recommendation from the CEO of the company for commitment and merit in all tasks performed in my domain.Such result has been achieved by studying throughout my master's degree (two years in September 2022) Power BI in the 
                          Business Intelligence course (completed with honors) related to the use of DAX language (creation of complex measures, calculated columns, time intelligence) and interactive dashboards. However, my passion for the world of Data Analysis does not end in the software learned so far; in fact, 
                          I am very eager to constantly continue to learn new tools to expand my analytical and technical knowledge, such as Tableau, SQL, and any other software that is necessary to learn for my professional career.
                          
   In addition, in parallel with my studies and the Business Analyst internship, I have completed a part-time six-months internship (March-September 2022) as Business Development Lead for The THRIVE Project. This is an Australian Non-profit and this role has let me developed strategies and growth plans by analysing market dynamics and characteristics of very different sectors, to indicate the best moves to spread the company's vision and mission.
I have been a Project manager involved so far in three crucial sustainability projects to promote the corporate framework and develop new partnerships and collaborations with organisations, institutions and NGOs working in the areas related to the 14 SDGs.
But not only that. Working for an organization with such a focus on environmental sustainability has also allowed me to getting closer to researchers from all over the world who are experts in every possible field, of all ages, with the opportunity to collaborate with them on various projects and consequently learning the type of approach used in research.

Among my passions and hobbies, I love travelling, hiking (and generally any kind of outdoor tourism), playing chess, watching TV series (especially anime), and meet new people from different cultures. Among all these, however, my greatest passion is music, of which I am a great devotee (especially the vast world of electronic music, but not only) of which you can find out all about in my Spotify profile (https://open.spotify.com/user/2147ostd2xil2uieljbmk6fri?si=9645c77e8082468e). In fact, I always like to discover new sounds and interesting songs and classify them into different playlists, to have something suitable to play in different situations and moods.
